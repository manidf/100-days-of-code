# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 04, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've setup the boilerplate for the project. Imported Axios HTTP client. Built up the Ajax query. Created a search component and search results component.

**Thoughts**: Vue Js templates was pretty easy to get started.

### Day 2: January 05, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: added v-for directive to render out the data i am getting from NYT API

**Thoughts**: nothing going yet, tomorrow is another day ;-)

### Day 2: January 06, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I fixed the Axios Ajax request. Opted not to have an inline arrow function, its more readable with braces as well, added catch to catch any errors. I can see the data rendering on the page now. Next up is to wire up the input field so that we can actually search the API and render a nice template under the search bar.

**Thoughts**: Vue is really fun to work with. easy peasy sorta kinda. Will get into component communication tomorrow to post the value of the search input to NYT API end point.
